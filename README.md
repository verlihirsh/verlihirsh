# Hi, I’m Olga 👋

I’ve been building boring, reliable backend systems for more than a decade.

**Software Developer · Engineering Lead · LLM Agent Systems Engineer**

---

### What I love to do
- Backend engineering  
- System architecture  
- Technical leadership  

### What I’m currently focused on
- Building reliable LLM-driven agent systems  
- Developing and tuning software development workflows to uncover the real potential of LLMs (not the hype)  
- Explaining why LLMs won’t replace your dev team—but will make it significantly more productive  

### What I stand for
- Explicit architecture and clear data flow  
- Simplicity beats cleverness  
- 90% of tasks should be solved with boring code  
- Observable systems with clear control surfaces  
- Reliable, maintainable solutions over excessive abstraction  
- Understanding the client’s needs is key to good architecture—not just technical skill  

### In general, I work at the intersection of
- Classical software engineering  
- Distributed systems  
- Automation and orchestration  
- Applied AI (LLMs as infrastructure, not demos)
